# Social Productivity Dashboard

> A no-code Airtable workspace that ingests your social bookmarks, auto-generates actionable tasks with n8n + LLM, and displays everything in a kanban & planning dashboard—so you can validate the workflow before investing in a full custom app.

- Track where I left off in business plans across different days
- Organize bookmarks and saves from multiple social platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Google mobile feed)
- Convert social discoveries into actionable tasks and project development
- Maintain productivity momentum with limited time (Fri-Sun available for business)
