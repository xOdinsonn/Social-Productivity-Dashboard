## Getting Started
1. Follow setup guide in `docs/phase-1/setup-guides/`
2. Configure Airtable base using files in `airtable/`
3. Import n8n workflows from `n8n-workflows/`
4. Set up integrations using `integrations/` configurations

## Development Notes
- All configurations documented for reproducibility
- AI-assisted development methodology applied throughout
- Real-world validation required before Phase 2 advancement
